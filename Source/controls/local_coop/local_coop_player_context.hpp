 * @brief RAII helper to temporarily swap MyPlayer, MyPlayerId, and InspectPlayer for local co-op actions.
 *
 * This ensures network commands are sent with the correct player ID and that
 * player-specific state is properly managed during action execution.
 * InspectPlayer is also swapped because UI elements like the spell menu use it.
 *
 * Usage:
 * @code
 * {
 *     LocalCoopPlayerContext context(playerId);
 *     // MyPlayer, MyPlayerId, and InspectPlayer now point to the specified player
 *     // ... perform actions as that player ...
 * } // Context restored to previous state
